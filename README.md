# Prediction-on-Bird-GPS-Data
Made 2 models using the GPS data of the bird

1) **Dive Prediction Model using Logistic Regression**
   
Objective: Predict whether a bird will dive at a given time or location.

2) **Time Series Forecasting using Neural Prophet**

Objective: Forecast future values of bird activity metrics such as maximum depth or coverage ratio over time.

CSV is quite big so I cannot upload it. Here is the link to the dataset :
